# Curriculum Vitae

Curriculum Vitae with [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a static page generator for [reactJs](https://reactjs.org/).

## Motivation

- I dislike centralisation that has cause LinkedIn to become a dominant platform for an online "work" identity

- I agree that there is some utility in having my work history, projects and certifications publicly available

- I wanted to apply some React knowledge that I learnt doing [A Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
and modifying a gatsby CV that [firsttris created](https://github.com/firsttris/gatsby-cv)
to meet my needs seemed like a good opportunity to try this out in an existing code base.

## Template, Author & License

Creating my own design seemed lame, I forked [A design made by Tristan Teufel](https://github.com/firsttris/gatsby-cv) 
which looked fantastic but needed a few things changed to fit my tastes.

Tristan cites https://github.com/xriley/pillar-theme by UX/UI designer [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes) 
as the design that he based his on.


## Bootstraping & Development

Based on best practices of [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

- src/data/ - JSON Files
- src/markdown-pages/ - Markdown Files
- src/templates - Templates (main source for generation)
- src/components - Components
- src/translations - Localization
- src/assets - Assets, pictures and stuff

for more information on how to get started with Gatsby if refer to https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/

    start-server-and-test develop http://localhost:8000 cy:run

```

## Deployment
Deployment is dealt with through GitHub Pages, check the `.github/workflows` folder for the details.

If you're setting this up yourself you'll want to check the [ReadMe](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
for GitHub Pages, and the section about [Setting up a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

## Testing
I use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) for some basic tests to make sure
the button is working and that some text exists on the webpage.

This testing can happen with the local version `npm run test:ci-develop` and with the live version `test:ci-live` hosted
by GitHub. If you need to change the URL check `cypress.config-live.js`.
