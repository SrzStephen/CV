# Curriculum Vitae

Curriculum Vitae with [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a static page generator for [reactJs](https://reactjs.org/).

## Motivation

- I dislike centralisation that has cause LinkedIn to become a dominant platform for an online identity

- I agree that there is some utility in having work information publicly available

- I wanted to apply some React knowlege that I learnt doing [A Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) and modifying the version [firsttris created](https://github.com/firsttris/gatsby-cv) to meet my needs seemed like a good opportunity.

## Template, Author & License

Creating my own design seemed lame, I forked [A design made by tristan teufel](https://github.com/firsttris/gatsby-cv) which looked fantastic but needed a few things changed to fit my tastes.

Tristan cites https://github.com/xriley/pillar-theme by UX/UI designer [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes) as the design that he based his on.
